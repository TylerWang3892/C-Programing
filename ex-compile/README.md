# Code Compilation Example

In the GitHub repository, there should be a folder called `ex-compile`. Use the `cd` and `ls` commands to change your working directory into `ex-compile` from whichever direction you are currently in. Once here, using GCC, compile this code. If you did everything correctly, you should get an executable that once run will print 
```
Yah,  you have learned to compile code :)
```

**HINT** Don’t compile the .h or the .md file (it will still work with the .h file, but in general, you don’t compile header files, which is what a .h file is)
